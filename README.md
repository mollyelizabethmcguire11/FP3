# FP3: Final Project Assignment 3: Exploration 2
Due Sunday, March 26, 2017

This assignment is the same as [FP1], except definitely choose a library that you expect to use for your full project.

You will be in your team before you complete this assignment. You and your teammate(s) must coordinate to (1) both choose libraries relevant to your project, and (2) each choose a different library.

The report template is below, beginning with "Library Name Here."

## How to Prepare and Submit This Assignment

1. To start, [**fork** this repository][forking]. 
1. Add your `.rkt` Racket source file(s) to the repository. 
1. Add any images to the repository.
1. Modify the `README.md` file and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your report.
1. Ensure your changes (report in `md` file, added `rkt` file(s), and images) are committed to your forked repository.

What I did for this exploration was to look for comparable objects to the power -ups that a player gets when
playing the classic flash game 'Bubble Trouble 2'. When bubbles are successfully popped, they occassionaly 
drop power ups that grant the player longer time on the map, a shield, a special harpoon weapon, etc.

I did some research (played the game enough to find out what shapes are which) and I tried my hand at 
recreating those shapes that I saw- as well as displaying them as they would appear in the game itself.

* highlights of code that you wrote, with explanation
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* at least one diagram or figure showing your work

The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. 

You need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be uploaded to your repository, and then displayed with markdown in this file; like this:
